# Pothole Detection using YOLOv8

## Overview
This repository provides an implementation of pothole detection using the YOLOv8 model. It leverages the Ultralytics library for object detection and focuses on identifying potholes in real-world scenarios to enhance road safety and assist in automated infrastructure management.

## Features
- **High-Accuracy Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model.
- **Easy Integration**: Built on the Ultralytics library for seamless implementation.
- **Customizable**: Supports fine-tuning on custom datasets for specific use cases.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pothole-detection-yolov8.git
   cd pothole-detection-yolov8
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install ultralytics
   ```

## Dataset Preparation
Prepare your dataset in YOLO format:
- Organize images and annotations into `train` and `val` directories.
- Ensure annotations are in the YOLO text format (`.txt`) corresponding to each image.

Directory structure:
```
├── dataset
│   ├── images
│   │   ├── train
│   │   └── val
│   ├── labels
│   │   ├── train
│   │   └── val
```


## Results
Results are saved in the `runs/detect` directory by default, with bounding boxes drawn around detected potholes.

## Applications
- Road safety enhancement.
- Automated road condition monitoring.
- Infrastructure management systems.
